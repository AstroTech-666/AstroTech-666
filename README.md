# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub! 🌍✨

- 👀 Hi there! I’m Farzana (Astrotech), and I’m deeply passionate about the intersection of quantum computing, quantum physics, and machine learning in solving some of the world’s most pressing challenges— climate change and environmental sustainability. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about emerging technologies in environmental science and how they can be applied to real-world challenges.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects focused on climate action, especially those that empower youth and communities to adopt sustainable practices.  
- 📫 How to reach me: You can connect with me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farzana-abdulzada-5382a7295/).

Let’s work together to create a future where technology and sustainability thrive hand in hand. 🌿💡
